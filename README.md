# Title
D-Utility: A tool for content based file distinction
# Abstract
Identifying the actual type of a file whether on the basis of content or extension can be of great difficulty. This minor project proposes algorithms to automatically distinct the files by their extensions and the text files by the type of content in them. Recognition is performed by extension algorithm and modified byte frequency analysis algorithm which will further help in classifying the type of file and their content.
